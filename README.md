# Bike-Sharing-Prediction

In this project, we build a neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.
We implement a basic MLP( Multi-Layer-Perceptron) network in order to do so.
Using concepts of backward propogation and gradient descent, the model is trained and used to predict the patterns in bike sharing i.e- at what day how many number of bikes would be required.
